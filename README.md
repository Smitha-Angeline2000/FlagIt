# FlagIt
FlagIt is a Civic Issue Reporting App that helps citizens take care of their surroundings by uploading the civic problem into the app that goes towards their rightful authorities
It streamlines reporting and significantly improves communication between citizens and govenment entities.

### What is the main issue?
The main problem that citizens are facing, is that there are unresolved civic issues in their neighbourhood. Many people don't know how to report it to the authorities and/or had their problem unresolved due to it being mailed to the wrong department or it might be that they're just scared.


### Why this app? Aren't there others already?
The main problem here is that there actually *isn't* any other app that has the same objective as ours. There are apps for banking, bill payment, education etc coming from the government, but no such app exists for any civic related issues specifically. Any problems in the citizen's neighbourhood goes unnoticed or ignored because of improper mailing systems and getting wrong emails sent to the wrong authorities. This app aims to correct that bridge by providing a singular app to connect with the rightful authorities and hold them accountable using the report count and completition meter. 

### How does the App work?
The app works as follows:
- User find the problem that needs immediate action (i.e potholes, broken streetlights, garbage dumps), clicks a photo and the app geo-tags it.
- The AI then classifies the issue as potholes, streetlights and garbagedumps and gives it a tag.
- The report is then sent with the picture, the location and severity (which the AI classifies) of the situation to the rightful muncipality department.
- The user is then able to track the report status of their reported issues and provides feedback once the issues are resolved.
